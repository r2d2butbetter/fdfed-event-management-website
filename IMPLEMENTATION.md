# Event Management System - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
This Event Management System demonstrates comprehensive front-end development concepts as outlined in your syllabus. The project uses modern JavaScript, React, Redux, and implements all required technologies.

## Syllabus Coverage

### Unit 1: Dynamic HTML/DOM & AJAX ✅
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Implemented in multiple components
  - `src/App.js`: Dynamic class addition/removal for themes
  - `src/pages/Home.js`: Dynamic title updates, smooth scrolling
  - `src/store/slices/appSlice.js`: Theme switching with DOM attribute updates
- **AJAX Implementation**: Complete REST API simulation
  - `src/services/api.js`: Axios configuration with interceptors
  - Mock API responses for development
  - Error handling and token management

### Unit 2: Advanced JavaScript & Browser Internals ✅
- **Modern JavaScript Features**:
  - ES6+ syntax throughout (arrow functions, destructuring, template literals)
  - Async/await patterns in Redux thunks
  - Promise handling in service layers
- **Browser APIs**:
  - LocalStorage for persistence
  - Navigator API (vibration, online status)
  - Event listeners for network status
- **SPA Architecture**: React Router implementation with protected routes

### Unit 3: React Framework Introduction ✅
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Organized component structure
  - Layout components (`Navbar`, `Footer`)
  - Page components (`Home`, `Dashboard`, `Login`, `Register`)
  - Reusable components (`LoadingSpinner`)
- **React Application Structure**: Professional folder organization

### Unit 4: Advanced React Components ✅
- **JSX**: Extensive use throughout all components
- **Component State & Props**: 
  - Local state with `useState`
  - Props passing between components
  - State lifting patterns
- **Lifecycle Methods**: 
  - `useEffect` for component mounting/unmounting
  - Cleanup functions for event listeners
- **React Router**: 
  - Nested routing
  - Protected routes with role-based access
  - Navigation guards
- **Virtual DOM**: Leveraged through React's reconciliation

### Unit 5: State Management with Redux ✅
- **Redux Store Configuration**: 
  - `src/store/store.js`: Complete store setup with persistence
- **Redux Slices**: 
  - `authSlice`: Authentication state management
  - `eventsSlice`: Event data management
  - `usersSlice`: User management
  - `appSlice`: Application-wide state
  - `bookingsSlice`: Booking management
- **Actions & Thunks**: Async operations with createAsyncThunk
- **Redux Forms**: Integration with React forms

## User Roles Implementation

### 1. Admin User
- **Features**: Complete system oversight
- **Dashboard**: User management, system statistics
- **Permissions**: All CRUD operations
- **Components**: `AdminDashboard.js`

### 2. Event Organizer
- **Features**: Event creation and management
- **Dashboard**: Event analytics, booking management
- **Permissions**: Create/edit own events, view attendees
- **Components**: `OrganizerDashboard.js`

### 3. Customer
- **Features**: Event discovery and booking
- **Dashboard**: Personal bookings, recommendations
- **Permissions**: Browse events, make bookings
- **Components**: `CustomerDashboard.js`

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18**: Latest React with Hooks
- **Redux Toolkit**: Modern Redux with RTK Query
- **React Router v6**: Latest routing with data APIs
- **Bootstrap 5**: Responsive UI framework
- **Axios**: HTTP client with interceptors

### Development Features
- **Hot Reload**: Fast development feedback
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling
- **TypeScript Ready**: Easy migration path
- **PWA Ready**: Service worker configuration available

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Demo Accounts**: Use the demo login buttons to test different user roles
   - Admin: admin@example.com / password
   - Organizer: jane@example.com / password
   - Customer: john@example.com / password

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **Complete Event Management**:
   - Event creation form with image upload
   - Event listing with filtering/search
   - Event details with booking functionality

2. **Booking System**:
   - Payment integration
   - Ticket generation
   - Email confirmations

3. **Advanced Features**:
   - Real-time notifications
   - Event analytics
   - Social sharing
   - Review system

4. **Backend Integration**:
   - Replace mock API with real backend
   - Database integration
   - Authentication server
   - File upload handling

## Learning Outcomes Achieved

- ✅ Dynamic HTML/DOM manipulation with modern JavaScript
